# Magistrat Context

## Active Phase
- Phase 0: Greenfield bootstrap.

## Active Epic
- Foundations + vertical trust-loop slice:
  - exemplar selection
  - deterministic checks
  - reversible patches
  - ratify + drift scaffolding

## Immediate Blocker
- Repository started empty; baseline architecture, contracts, and docs had to be created from scratch.

## Immediate Priorities (next 2 weeks)
1. Stand up monorepo with locked shared contracts.
2. Ship PowerPoint task-pane shell with host diagnostics.
3. Implement deterministic IR, role inference, and exemplar health.
4. Introduce findings engine and safe/caution/manual patch planning.
5. Establish test coverage for role inference, scoring, findings integrity, and patch policy.
6. Harden Office adapter runtime path with load-sync-read batching and chunked execution.
7. Add per-feature requirement-set capability gates with explicit NOT_ANALYZED fallback reasons.
8. Add Windows (WebView2) and Mac (WebKit) parity verification scenarios for host behavior differences.

## Decisions Locked For v1
- Windows + Mac Desktop target.
- In-document state persistence only.
- End-to-end trust loop prioritized over breadth.
- XML manifest-first for widest enterprise desktop compatibility; reevaluate unified manifest when Copilot/Teams scope is explicit.
