# Magistrat UX Rules

## Core Flow
1. Choose exemplar and inspect health.
2. Run clean-up checks for selected scope.
3. Review findings with evidence, confidence, and risk.
4. Apply/revert typed patches.
5. Ratify style status and monitor drift.

## Required UI Elements (v1)
- Exemplar selection with original vs normalized choice.
- Findings list grouped by slide/role/rule.
- Coverage meter showing analyzed and not analyzed states.
- Patch log with reconciliation state and revert actions.
- Session diagnostics for host and document state schema.

## Guardrails
- No hidden automated mutations.
- No floating overlay sprawl; task-pane-first workflow.
- No high-risk geometry or master/layout mutations in v1.
